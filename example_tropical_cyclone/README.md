# Tropical cyclone detection

This example uses the [TempestExtremes tracking algorithm](https://climate.ucdavis.edu/tempestextremes.php) as an example of a scientific application for the Climate DT data. 

To run this example you must either run the [desp-authentication.py](https://github.com/destination-earth-digital-twins/polytope-examples/blob/main/desp-authentication.py) on the machine where you want to run the example, or you must add your user name and key in the file [get_climate_dt_data.py](). 

To run the example you need a working python environment. Try it out by running `python main.py`.
