# Resources for users of the Climate DT data.

[DestinE](https://destination-earth.eu/) is an initiative of the European Commission which includes the operationalization of multi-decadal climate simulations using km-scale global models. Several multi-decadal scenario simulations as well as storyline simulations have been performed with the [Climate Change Adaptation Digital Twin](https://destine.ecmwf.int/climate-change-adaptation-digital-twin-climate-dt/#What-is-the-Climate-DT) (Climate DT) and are being integrated into the DestinE platform. Models underlying the Climate DT are ICON, IFS-NEMO, and IFS-FESOM.

This repository contains introduction materials and examples for those who are interested in accessing and analysing the Climate DT data.

**Note:** Upgraded access to the DestinE data platform is required for data access and must be requested via https://platform.destine.eu/access-policy-upgrade/ and one must abide by the DestinE data policies.

It is a good idea to start from our [short introduction](link missing), which answers many frequent questions on how to access the DestinE data via DESP.
